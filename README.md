# medical_charges_analysis_2026
This analysis uses a medical charges database to analyze the differences and similarities to charges accrued by those recorded.
The database used in this analysis consists of a table (medical_charges mc) with the columns age, sex (male or female), bmi, children (whether they have kids), smoker (yes or no), region, and charges.

This analysis focuses on 5 main questions-

Do smokers pay more in medical charges on average?

Does age affect the amount paid on average?

What region has the highest average charger per age group?

How do the charges of those who do and do not smoke and are of similar ages and sex compared?

A BMI over 24.9 is considered overweight for the average American. Does being over this limit affect your medical charges?

Findings-

Based on our data the average non-smoker spent $8,434 in medical charges while the average smoker spent $32,050. Meaning a smoker spent 79.16% more on medical charges than the non smoker.

As age increases so does the average medical charges showing that the older patients spend more on average than the younger. 

The region with the highest average charge per age group is southeast in most cases. When ages are separated into bins of 10-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, and 51+ we are able to tell that southeast has the highest average charges in all age groups aside from 31-40 where southwest has the highest at 12010 and 10-20 where northwest has 9,773. Based on this information we can infer the hospitals in the southeast charge more, however a more rigorous analysis would be required to conform this.

When compairing medical charges of people of simmilar age ans sex who do and do not smoke we can see a jerastic differance between the too. Smokins bad for you, who knew?

Lastly we compared the average charges accumulated by people with BMIs over  and under 24.9. This number was chosen because 24.9 BMI is considered normal in the US while a BMI over this is considered overweight. People with a BMI over 24.9 pay about 7.6% more than those  with a BMI of 24.9 or lower, while this may be significant further analysis would be recommended.
